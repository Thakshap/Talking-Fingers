# Talking-Fingers
Talking Fingers is a web app that translates spoken or typed text into Indian Sign Language (ISL) animations. Using the Web Speech API, googletrans, and NLTK, it supports multiple Indian languages, processes text, and maps it to ISL animations. Built with Django, it fosters inclusivity and bridges communication gaps.
